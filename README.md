## 🔥 How It Works

### 1. Questions Stage

- There are **10 short questions**, mostly one-word answers about computers and personal jokes.
- When a correct answer is typed:
  - Each letter is linked to a **number** from a secret mapping.
  - Letters already discovered keep the same number; duplicates are avoided.
- If the answer is incorrect or `help` is typed:
  - The question is shown again.
  - Blanks (`_`) display the answer letters.
  - Numbers under the blanks hint at already discovered letters.

This encourages **co-op play**, where one player may know certain numbers and help the other.
